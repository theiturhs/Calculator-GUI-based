# Calculator

The code is written in Python using Tkinter library. The calculator design is inspired by windows calculator.

Working of code is as follows:

The user enters the expression which is stored in string data type.
This expression is converted to list which separates the operands and operators.
Then, this expression list is in infix format which is converted to postfix format.
Further, the result is calculated from postfix expression.
And finally, the result is displayed.
